# machine-learning-challenge - ReadMe

The purpose of this assignment was to explore, manipulate and build and then compare multiple machine learning models from the [NASA Kepler Space Telescope](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)
dataset.

This Github Repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for each model and the data wrangling process used to build the algorithm ready dataset.
